This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

# Getting Started
These instructions will guide you on how to set up and run the project on your new machine.

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following software installed:

Node.js, npm or Yarn,  Git
## Installation

1. Clone the project repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Programming-is-like-breathing-air/WYSIWYG-Editor-.git
cd your-project
```
2. Install project dependencies:
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```
3. Configure environment variables:

- Create a .env file in the project root directory.
- Copy the content from .env.example and paste it into .env.
- Edit the .env file with your specific environment variables (e.g., database connection string to change your database name and password).
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Then edit .env with the correct values
```
4. Generate Prisma client:
```bash
npx prisma generate
```
5. Run database migrations:
- Run the following command to create or update the database schema.
```bash
npx prisma migrate dev
# or
npx prisma migrate deploy
```
6. Import initial data into database
- Open the importTask.js file and change your database connection string and run this command.
```bash
node importUser.js
```
7.Running the Project
- After following the installation steps, you can start the project using:
```bash
node index
```
```bash
npm run dev
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
